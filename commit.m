Explanation
H3 Index Usage

    Stop Matching: isSameStop prioritizes hexid equality, using lat/lng only if hexid is missing or mismatched. This leverages H3’s geospatial precision.
    Stop Keys: In stopToRoute, we use hexid as the primary key, falling back to a lat/lng string. This ensures consistent stop identification.

Cartesian Product

    findTransferPoints:
        Performs a Cartesian product of routes (O(n²) pairs) and checks each stop pair (O(m²) where m is average stops per route).
        Outputs an array of transfer objects, e.g., { route1: "1", route2: "102", stop: { latitude, longitude, hexid } }.
    Route Graph: routeGraph uses these transfers to build an adjacency list, enabling BFS to jump between routes efficiently.

BFS

    Route-Based: BFS operates on routes, checking if the destination is on the current route, then exploring transferable routes via routeGraph.
    Optimization: Precomputed transfers reduce runtime stop comparisons, though preprocessing takes O(n² * m²).

Additional Locations

    Greedy: Chains BFS calls for each segment (start → additional → destination), summing bus counts. Returns -1 if any segment fails.

Concept

    Helix as a Path Guide: Treat the helix points (locations with H3 indexes) as a directed sequence from start to destination. Each point represents a stop where we need to find or transfer to a bus route.
    Transfer Optimization: Use the helix to filter and prioritize routes that overlap with its H3 indexes, then use transfers (via Cartesian product) to connect these segments efficiently.
    H3 Proximity: Expand each helix point’s H3 index with a gridDisk (e.g., 1-ring neighbors) to capture nearby stops, enhancing transfer possibilities without exhaustive searching.

Updated Approach

    Build Helix Structure: Keep it simple with lat/lng and H3 indexes, but add a nearbyHexes field for each point to include 1-ring neighbors.
    Precompute Transfers: Use the Cartesian product to identify all possible transfer points between routes.
    Optimized BFS:
        Start with routes overlapping the helix’s origin.
        Use the helix points to guide the search, checking for routes that cover subsequent points or allow transfers to reach them.
        Minimize buses by preferring routes that span multiple helix points in one go.


Key Changes
Helix Structure Optimization

    Simplified: Removed 3D spiral coordinates (helixX, helixY, helixZ) since they’re not needed for routing.
    Enhanced: Added nearbyHexes (1-ring H3 neighbors) to each point, expanding the search radius (~150m at resolution 9) for better transfer matching.
    Purpose: Acts as a sequential guide for the BFS, ensuring we progress from start to destination via waypoints.

Transfer Optimization

    Cartesian Product: findTransferPoints identifies all possible transfers using H3-based isSameStop, which now considers nearby hexes.
    Route Graph: Built from transfers, allowing efficient route-to-route jumps.
    Helix-Guided BFS:
        Tracks the current helixIdx (position along the helix).
        Checks how many consecutive helix points a route covers, minimizing bus changes.
        Only explores transfers when the current route can’t reach the next helix point.

BFS Logic

    Queue: Includes helixIdx to track progress along the helix.
    Visited: Uses a Map to store minimum buses per route, ensuring we don’t revisit with higher costs.
    Path Building: Returns the sequence of route numbers that reaches the destination.

Removed

    Directions API: Completely removed since it’s not needed with YesBana.json.
    Unnecessary Utils: Stripped decodePolyline, getNearbyRoutes, etc., as they’re redundant with the new approach.
Key Changes

    RBush Integration:
        buildRouteRBush: Indexes all matatu route points (pickup and destinations) into an RBush tree. Destinations are treated as potential pickups, supporting your bidirectional idea.
        findOverlappingRoutes: Uses routeTree.search to find matatu routes overlapping each user helix point within a ~3 km bounding box.
    Cartesian Product:
        findValidPaths: Generates all combinations of routes per segment using a Cartesian product, then filters for valid paths that:
            Cover most user points (via overlaps).
            Allow transfers (via routeGraph).
    Route Graph:
        buildRouteGraph: Builds a transfer graph by checking spatial overlaps between routes using RBush, assuming routes overlap if points are within ~3 km.
    Matching Logic:
        Matches user helix points to matatu routes via RBush, then constructs paths that approximate the user’s route, relaxing the strict start/end requirement.

How It Works with Your Input

    User Helix: Thika (-1.0388, 37.0834) → Buruburu (-1.2857, 36.8562) → Langata (-1.2978, 36.7894).
    RBush Query:
        Thika: No direct match, but relaxed radius might catch Nairobi routes.
        Buruburu: Matches Route 58’s destination (-1.2857, 36.8562).
        Langata: Matches Route 15’s destinations (-1.2978, 36.7894).
    Overlaps: overlaps maps "58" to Buruburu, "15" to Langata.
    Cartesian Product: Combines ["58"], ["15"] into paths like ["58", "15"].
    Validation: Checks if "58" and "15" overlap (e.g., via Nairobi pickup points) and cover the route.

Testing

    Update YesBana.json with your data.
    Run: npx http-server, open http://localhost:8080/test.html.
    Input: Origin="Thika, Kenya", Additional="Buruburu, Nairobi, Kenya", Destination="Langata, Nairobi, Kenya".
    Check:
        Console: Look for Route overlaps, Route graph, Valid paths.
        #bus-routes: Should list ["58", "15"] or similar if overlaps and transfers align.

Expected Improvement

    Accuracy: RBush ensures precise spatial overlap detection.
    Flexibility: Cartesian product finds multi-route combinations, treating destinations as pickups.
    Output: Should now return routes like "58" (to Buruburu) and "15" (to Langata) instead of an empty array.

If "No bus routes found" persists, check the console logs for overlaps and routeGraph to see where the matching fails!
